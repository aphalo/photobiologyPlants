Package '**photobiologyPlants**' provides pre-defined functions for quantifying
visible ('VIS') and ultraviolet ('UV') radiation in relation to their efefcts on
plants together with action spectra for photosynthesis and absorbance spectra
for the plant photoreceptors in families 'phytochromes', 'cryptochromes',
'phototropins' and 'UVR8s' which are present in plants. It also includes data
sets on the optical properties of plant organs, photosynthesis and plant
pigments, chlorophylls and carotenoids. All data are derived from the scientific
literature. Please, see the help pages for the different data sets for details
about the sources used.

The data in this package are stored in objects of classes defined in package 
'**photobiology**' which are mostly backwards compatible with data frames.

This package is part of a suite of R packages for photobiological calculations described at the [r4photobiology](https://www.r4photobiology.info) web site.

## Examples

```{r example1, message=FALSE}
library(ggspectra)
library(photobiologyPlants)
```

We plot the action spectrum of photosynthesis in Oats.

```{r example2}
comment(McCree_photosynthesis.mspct$oats)
```

```{r}
class(McCree_photosynthesis.mspct$oats)
```

```{r example1a, message=FALSE}
autoplot(McCree_photosynthesis.mspct$oats, 
         annotations = c("+", "title:none:what"))
```

We can calculate the R:FR photon ratio of a spectrum, in this case an example solar spectrum at ground level from package 'photobiology'.

```{r}
R_FR(sun.spct)
```
We can also estimate the photo-equilibrium of phytochrome exposed _in vitro_ to the same spectrum. 

```{r}
Pfr_Ptot(sun.spct)
```


## Installation

Installation of the most recent stable version from CRAN:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("photobiologyLamps")
```

Installation of the current unstable version from Bitbucket:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_bitbucket("aphalo/photobiologylamps")
```

## Documentation 

HTML documentation is available at (https://docs.r4photobiology.info/photobiologyPlants/), including a _User Guide_.

News on updates to the different packages of the 'r4photobiology' suite are regularly posted at (https://www.r4photobiology.info/).

Two articles introduce the basic ideas behind the design of the suite and describe its use:
Aphalo P. J. (2015) (https://doi.org/10.19232/uv4pb.2015.1.14) and Aphalo P. J. (2016)  (https://doi.org/10.19232/uv4pb.2016.1.15).

A book is under preparation, and the draft is currently available at (https://leanpub.com/r4photobiology/).

A handbook written before the suite was developed contains useful information on the quantification and manipulation of ultraviolet and visible radiation:
Aphalo, P. J., Albert, A., Björn, L. O., McLeod, A. R., Robson, T. M., & Rosenqvist, E. (Eds.) (2012) Beyond the Visible: A handbook of best practice in plant UV photobiology (1st ed., p. xxx + 174). Helsinki: University of Helsinki, Department of Biosciences, Division of Plant Biology. ISBN 978-952-10-8363-1 (PDF), 978-952-10-8362-4 (paperback).
