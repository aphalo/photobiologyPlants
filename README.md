# R package 'photobiologyPlants' #

[![](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/photobiologyPlants)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=photobiologyPlants) 

Package '**photobiologyPlants**' provides pre-defined functions for quantifying
visible ('VIS') and ultraviolet ('UV') radiation in relation to their efefcts on
plants together with action spectra for photosynthesis and absorbance spectra
for the plant photoreceptors in families 'phytochromes', 'cryptochromes',
'phototropins' and 'UVR8s' which are present in plants. It also includes data
sets on the optical properties of plant organs, photosynthesis and plant
pigments, chlorophylls and carotenoids. All data are derived from the scientific
literature. Please, see the help pages for the different data sets for details
about the sources used.

This package is part of a suite of R packages for photobiological calculations 
described at the [r4photobiology](https://www.r4photobiology.info) web site.
