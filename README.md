Package '**photobiologyPlants**' provides pre-defined functions for quantifying 
visible ('VIS') and ultraviolet ('UV') radiation in relation to the
photoreceptors 'Phytochromes', 'Cryptochromes', and 'UVR8' which are present in
plants. It also includes data sets on the optical properties of plants.

This package is part of a suite of R packages for photobiological calculations described at the [r4photobiology](http://www.r4photobiology.info) web site.
